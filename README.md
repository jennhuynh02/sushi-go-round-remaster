# 🍣 Sushi-Go-Round Remaster (WIP)

A modern remaster of my original bootcamp-era Sushi-Go-Round game.  
This project is being rebuilt with **React + TypeScript + Vite**, and a custom HTML5 Canvas game engine.  

The goal: take a working prototype and evolve it into a polished, production-quality web game —  
showcasing **clean architecture, modern tooling, accessibility, and UI/UX polish.**

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) – lightning-fast dev server & build
- [React](https://react.dev/) – shell UI (menus, settings, leaderboard)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) – typed game engine
- HTML5 Canvas – rendering layer for the game loop
- ESLint + Prettier – code quality
- (Planned) Tailwind CSS – quick UI styling
- (Planned) Supabase – global leaderboard

## 🛠️ Development Status
- ✅ Repo scaffolded with Vite + React + TypeScript
- ✅ Initial setup committed
- ⏳ Next: Canvas game skeleton + basic input handling
- ⏳ Later: spawning system, scoring, HUD, accessibility modes, deploy to GitHub Pages
